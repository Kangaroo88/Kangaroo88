- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kangaroo88
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding, (obviously) UX/UI and general design, robotics, learning languages, biology, hematology, law and legal studies, history, philosophy, digital and tradtional art and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning languages such as Arabic, Japanese and French, and am fluent in Urdu, Hindi, and English. (Also done Greek and Chinese on Duolingo, but that's on a smaller scale.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is a learning experience; I'm always looking to learn more! :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Use my email if you have it ;)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started learning Japanese before finding out about Anime. Still pretty cool though. But before that I was still a Nintendo nerd.
